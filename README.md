A drop dead way to implement Color Cube in a CoreImage filter

The Color Cube Core Image filter is [woefully](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/graphicsimaging/conceptual/CoreImaging/ci_filer_recipes/ci_filter_recipes.html) [undocumented](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/graphicsimaging/reference/CoreImageFilterReference/Reference/reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/filter/ci/CIColorCube).

####So, let's talk about [Color Lookup Tables](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colour_look-up_table).

Essentially, if you were think of each RGBA value having a color associated with it, think of a dictionary (or a "lookup" "table") that has uses that RGBA value as a key which then returns a new value to use in it's place. 

The roots in LUTs come from computer graphics and video games in order to quickly alter the appearance of graphics without a heavy cost. In fact, it was [this article](http://udn.epicgames.com/Three/ColorGrading.html) that got the ball rolling. 

How so? Apple describes their color cube as this:

But in actuality, it looks like this:

####Great.

InstaCube takes a key image, translates it to NSData that CIFilter Color Cube understands and set it to the correct InputKey that the CIFilter needs. 

What this means is that you take a generic key image like what's above and, using a photo editing application, apply color transformations that are uniform (think saturation, curves, levels, color multiplication) and not coordinate specific (think gradient, pattern overlay, masks, etcâ€¦). Afterwards, save the image, import and use with the following methods:

    + (CIFilter *)instaCubeWithKeyImageName:(NSString *)keyImageString onBundle:(NSBundle *)bundleOrNil;

    + (CIFilter *)instaCubeWithKeyImage:(UIImage *)keyImage;
    
The resulting CIFilter will be of the type ColorCube but still need an input image in order to get the resulting output image.
